# Web Arduino Compile API

Modeled after [Chromeduino's compilation server](https://github.com/spaceneedle/Chromeduino/tree/master/Chromeduino%20Server)

Built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [arduino-cli](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/).

## Configuration
`config.js` allows you to customize the port the server listens on, as well as the invocation of `arduino-cli`. You can also disable the default verbose logging.
